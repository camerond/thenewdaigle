"It's not supernaria, but you know, it's nice to have."

"... what?"

"What? What'd I say?"

"You said 'supernaria'. What is supernaria?"

"Oh. Um. I meant to say 'supernecessary'. Sorry. Pregnancy Brain."

Actual conversation. Actual multisyllabic word creation. They don't warn you about Pregnancy Brain.

Shannon's pregnancy, so far, has been characterized primarily by _unpredictability._ Some days, she's bopping around, happy as can be, shopping and cleaning and sewing and what-have-you. Other days, I'll return home to the same bedridden figure that I left in the morning, at which point I perform my duties as a delivery service (specializing in sour straws, iced tea and tortillas).

Aside from my role as the CEO of Snack'n'Sweets Delivery Inc., my role as father-to-be is still mostly psychological at this point. I'm the oldest of eight and the child of two medical degrees, so many aspects of the whole baby-creation thing aren't particularly foreign or intimidating -- there was a baby of some form around for most of my childhood.

However, the physical evidence is starting to set in, and no previous experience can properly predict how that will feel. I will post a baby-bump (I despise that term, it sounds like a speed bump made of babies) photo with the next entry -- she's mostly just lost the ability to suck in her stomach at this point, as her stomach is (apparently) up around her ribcage now.

Shannon has also ordered TND's first set of cloth diapers. They're tiny. I held one in my hand, and for the first time, I pictured my hand holding my own child.
