I will have a firstborn son.

He's healthy. He has all his fingers and toes, and weighs 11 ounces, and wiggles around, and grabs his feet.

More to come soon, but I have to get back to work now. Shannon will also be writing soon; she's been waiting until after this appointment assured us that everything was going well.

Oh, and I can't provide you any naming information, other than that his middle name will be Philip, like my own and my father's.
