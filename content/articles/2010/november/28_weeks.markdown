Hi, blog! It's me, the mom!

We have 12 weeks to go! And there is most definitely a tiny person inside of me, a person who loves to kick and punch and head-butt all my internal organs, but most of all, my bladder and intestines. Obviously I want this child to continue baking for a while, but I am glad he'll be making an appearance sooner than later, because OUCH. (Although, despite the gymnastics routines happening inside of my body, it is super-surreal and cool to have contact with our son.)

We're in a weird kind of limbo right now, where things sort of seem all "la-de-dah, business as usual, nothing is happening, I have been pregnant forever!" And then I realize that in 12 WEEKS OMG we will no longer be a married couple, but a three-person family. And one of us will be particularly tiny, helpless and hungry.

I also had a small panic attack recently when I realized that, depending on when I go into labor, 12 weeks could be the generous estimate of how much time we have left. And yet, we have not even begun planning, let alone working on, the baby's room, or even figured out a name for the little guy. Hold me.

We also made the decision to switch doctors 22 weeks into this entire process, which we feel GREAT about, but was a little stressful. I'll write more on that, along with some of our birthing choices, later this week or something.

Until then, anyone have any brilliant name suggestions?
