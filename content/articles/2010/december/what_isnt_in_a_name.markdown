Thanks to everyone who wrote in with suggestions in the last entry! In appreciation for your generous input, we've decided to name our kid Ezra Roman Miles Keller Lincoln Eden Sawyer Westmoreland Winston Micah Collin Dillon Montgomery Jaden Jayden Keyumber Daigle.

J SLASH K, although we might as well, seriously. This whole name situation is far more multifaceted then the naming of our cat, for example (entire conversation, paraphrased: "We should name her an old lady's name." "How about Jemima?" "Possibly racist." "How about Stella?" "Done."). There are so many layers of possible feelings about _any_ name -- prepare yourself, for I will now demonstrate with the above names.

- __Collin:__ I think of Colin Farrell, who threatens my manliness with his own scruffy Irish variant while simultaneously being a serious bummer in terms of acting chops, and Colin Mochrie, who, while a funny person, is a small sad bald man.

- __Montgomery:__ Possibly due to the above, I think of Colin Montgomerie, fat British pro golfer.

- __Micah:__ I'm not a huge fan of any Bible book names (see also: Ezra) (no offense to the Bible and all that), and I think of Micah from Five Iron Frenzy, who, while awesome, is fat AND bald. (I apologize for being sizeist and baldist when it comes to my child's future.)

- __Lincoln:__ My grandmother would probably refuse to recognize the existence of our child were he named Lincoln.

- __Keller:__ Dustin Keller has been really letting me down this year at tight end for my fantasy team.

- __Miles:__ At least three of my siblings were almost named Miles (my parents preferred to prepare two names and let the gender be a surprise).

Do you see? Do you see what I mean? Absolutely _zero_ of the above reasons are even _remotely_ on the level of "A person named Sawyer killed my dad" (to be clear: a person named Sawyer has not as of yet even mildly injured my dad), but are the associated feelings, however trivial, any more or less valid? 

Names store meaning. They're like a database (non-technical folk: library) reference for memories. I think what most worries me is that memories associated with our child's name will never overwrite the previous memories of that name. However: I nave no doubt that this worry is completely irrational and that nothing will mean more than our child, no matter his name.
