title: "Birthin' Choices: Natural Birth"

Without question, one of the biggest decisions every woman makes about her pregnancy is how, exactly, she will go about the actual birthing.  I think one of the most intimidating (and frustrating) things about this is that even if you decide to breeze through your pregnancy by just showing up at doctor appointments, then go to the hospital when you are in labor, you are still making a decision about your labor and delivery experience (no pressure, ladies!)

Personally, I'd just always assumed that I'd have a natural birth; that's the way my own mom did it, so it seemed like the most comfortable and logical choice. Women in my family also have a certain reputation for going into and through labor so quickly that by the time they get to the hospital, there just isn't any time for drugs (please let me be so lucky.)

Not to mention, the thought of getting an epidural completely terrifies me -- even more than the thought of a non-medicated birth. I don't even really like taking normal over-the-counter medications that make me feel woozy, so voluntarily allowing someone to stick a GIANT NEEDLE INTO MY BACK that puts me out of touch with part of my body is kind of out of the question.

So, knowing that there was a fair chance that I may not be allowed meds combined with the fact that there was no way in hell that my first choice would be a needle in my spine, I decided to sign up for a natural birthing class. We ended up going with a [Bradley Method](http://www.bradleybirth.com/) class, which we love (and we absolutely recommend [Cecilia Mitchell](http://www.birthyourwayjax.com/) to anyone in the Jax area).

Between the class and a lot of research and reading, I was kind of surprised at how passionate I ended up feeling about natural childbirth. In the beginning for me, it was something that I mostly wanted to be prepared for trying to do (or having to do) -- now, as long as it's within our power and barring any medical complications, I'm determined to have this baby naturally.

I still support the individual choice of each mother to choose her own birthing experience, but please make an active choice -- do a little research and make informed decisions. Learn about induction medications and procedures, read about the effects of medications on mothers and babies, and research the methods your doctor or midwife will be using to evaluate your situation when you are in labor -- and know your options!

Obviously, thousands of medical inductions, pain meds, and C-sections are given every day, and babies come out "just fine", but it's shocking how little research it takes to find out that if you have the choice, induction, c-sections, and/or medicated birth aren't always the best things for your baby (or you). It's somewhere between crazy and outrageous to think about the number of women who receive these procedures when our bodies were made to do this.

I realize that my enthusiasm for natural birth might come off as a little trite, considering I have yet to actually go through any part of labor, and I absolutely hate when people get all judgmental on moms who choose (or truly have to have) medical interventions, so I'll spare you the lengthy facts, figures & arguments. But I can't recommend enough that anyone who's pregnant or considering having kids at least find out about how your body handles pregnancy and labor (seriously, you'll be amazed) and how that fits together with medical procedures behind birthing.

Since this has already gotten pretty lengthy, I'll save the details of our decision to switch doctors mid-pregnancy for the next post. But I'll leave you with a reading list for anyone interested in learning more about natural childbirth:
