![The first sonogram.](/images/sonogram_1.jpg)

The beginning of a journey.

Here he/she is, helpfully labeled via the hospital's imaging software.

The New Daigle is on the way, with a heartbeat (that we could hear via the sonogram -- so fast, an excited patter) -- and fingers. The books say that TND will be able to hear sounds in the next couple of weeks.

The books also say TND is the size of a lima bean, which is a strange measurement tool; by the time I write this, TND is probably the size of a butterbean?

All the books seem to use fruit/vegetable measurements. For example, one of the books says our baby will soon be the size of "a small orange". Couldn't the books have picked a fruit that didn't require a size modifier? "Small" orange? Perhaps ... a nectarine? Or a plum?

In any case. Expect posts from both myself (the proud father) and Shannon (the gallant mother) in the coming months. We'll be journaling the entire journey; we'd love to have you read along. We're excited.
