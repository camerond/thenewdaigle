I'm 26 now, which seems like a sensible age to father a child. My own father was 24 when I came forth to dignify the human race with my presence, so it's possible that my impressions skew young.

Given the above information, let us extrapolate. I will be:

- __26__ when TND is born
- __27__ when TND begins to walk
- __29__ when TND begins to read
- __31__ when TND completely massacres the first grade with their dazzling intelligence and forces us to homeschool them or place them 3 or 4 grades higher
- __36__ when Shannon or myself (gender-dependent) has to take the poor kid aside and give them the 'let's get you some deodorant' speech
- __37__ (if TND is male) when TND gives up on athletics after realizing that everyone else has had a growth spurt and they're going to one day be the standard Daigle height of 5'10" or shorter
- __38__ when they finally become old enough to mow my lawn
- __40__ when TND gets to experience my version of the _harrowing_ "surprise! let's learn to drive in this parking lot RIGHT HERE" standard-transmission ambush that my father pulled on me
- __42__ when I have to supply them with some ramshackle excuse for a vehicle
- __43__ when I have to ship the kid off to college
- __47__ when I get to stop paying college tuition

I'm afraid to go any farther than that. The astute reader will undoubtedly note that I left out certain crucial landmarks, such as the inevitable conversation re: _sexin'_ as well as the first time I have to corner either my daughter's impetuous boyfriend or my impetuous son. Certain things are hard to pin down; always in motion is the future.

Plus, I'm fairly certain that the above bulleted items will someday become inextricably _commingled_ with a second, equally vexing list.
