Shannon's in bed already, so I don't have access to my primary source of Baby Progress Knowledge (it's Shannon). However, Google is basically a doctor! (Disclaimer: Google is not a doctor, nor a reliable, non-terrifying source of reliable medical information.)

Anyway, Google will have to suffice tonight. I present to you information from [babycenter.com!](http://www.babycenter.com/6_your-pregnancy-12-weeks_1101.bc)

TND:

- is 12 weeks old
- has reflexes
- has eye muscles that clench

and, most importantly, the Produce Analogy:

- TND is "about the size of a lime"

Delicious!

> His face looks unquestionably human: His eyes have moved from the sides to the front of his head, and his ears are right where they should be.

Human face, ears in proper location: good news! Thanks for delivering that good news about TND's ear location in a slightly weird way, BabyCenter!

However, there's another little bit which makes me slightly uncomfortable:

> His intestines, which have grown so fast that they protrude into the umbilical cord, will start to move into his abdominal cavity about now, and his kidneys will begin excreting urine into his bladder.

That's an awfully matter-of-fact way to deliver that information, BabyCenter Dot Com. In any other context (say, all of the _Aliens_ movies), the news that someone's intestines are protruding from their body is met with panic, machine-gun fire and/or Bill Paxton notifying us of the state of the game (it's "over, man", fyi).

I'm also a little weirded out by BabyCenter's insistence on using the masculine pronoun. It's not like I don't want a boy, or anything (I'm slightly more intimidated by having a boy, but will expound in a later post), but seriously, BabyCenter, keep your assumptions to yourself. We have enough of those going around as it is.
