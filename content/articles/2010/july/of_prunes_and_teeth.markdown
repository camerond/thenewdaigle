So, Shannon has been reading baby books (Shannon has been reading EVERY baby book), and updates me every day regarding the status of our new human: currently, The New Daigle is the size of a prune, and is developing the following organs/parts:

- joints
- teeth
- kidneys
- testicles (if male)

That's right -- apparently a prune-sized human baby has TEETH. If I was in charge, I'd probably delay the development of teeth until later in the process; that definitely seems like a 2.0 feature, but who am I to say, really.

Working kidneys means a working excretory system, by the way. I asked Shannon how she felt about having a prune peeing inside of her on a regular basis, and she seemed more or less fine with it. (Until next week's produce-related update, I'm referring to our baby as "the peeing prune".)

Shannon ate a spicy chicken sandwich at Chick-fil-A today, and a few hours later she grabbed my shoulder and proceeded to _plea_ that I prevent her from stopping her spicy-food cravings for the forseeable future. Poor thing; she's dealing with some bad days, but she's a trooper. I respect her for it; I'm sure it's remarkably hard on one's digestive system to create an entire new person from scratch.
