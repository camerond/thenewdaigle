The most common phrase I've heard when talking to friends and/or family about TND is some variation of "your life is never going to be the same."

Some people have dropped the "your life is never going to etc. etc." verbatim, while smiling (smirking, really) and leaning back in a chair, others over the phone (although I assume the smirk is fairly universal). But without a narrative context, the contraction "gonna", an exclamation point, or a prefix of "That's so wonderful, Cameron!", that phrase looks tremendously ominous.

Here's what I want you to do, though: Read the last sentence again and picture a perennially-serious actor (I suggest Michael Caine) saying those words to you, without breaking eye contact, slowly and quietly. You ready? 

__Your life is never going to be the same.__

Okay, it's me again. Hope you came through that okay. If you feel convicted about your future, relax, it's just that your mental impersonation of Michael Caine is above average.

If you're curious (you totally are), we _were_ going to start formally 'trying' later this year, but I don't mind telling you that TND was not a 'planned' conception, just like I don't mind telling you that we are _absolutely_ finding out TND's gender -- a first child is no time for charades! (It's more like Pictionary, I guess (that sound you're hearing is your own groan of frustration and/or confusion).)

Here's the thing, though: the abrupt news, the good-natured smirk/warnings from friends, the literally daily addition of organs/features to TND -- these events don't add up to be nearly as intimidating as I would have expected. I think it's because part of my personal philosophy (by the way, if you want to become abruptly aware of the nuances of your personal philosophy, conceive a child) that I _expect_ the decisions I make and experiences I have to to change my life forever.

What I'm trying to say is I'm disappointed in anything that _doesn't_ change my life forever, on some level or another. My life is supposed to be a cumulative motion, onward and upward. So what good is any experience that leaves me exactly the same?
